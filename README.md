# Express.js JSON Body Parsing Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with JSON request bodies in Express.js applications.

## Problem

The provided Express.js code snippet uses `express.json()` middleware to parse JSON data from incoming requests. However, in some scenarios, the `req.body` object may remain empty or undefined, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Solution

The solution involves verifying the correct placement and configuration of the `express.json()` middleware.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
3. Run `node bug.js` to start the server with the buggy code.
4. Send a POST request to `/data` with a JSON payload to reproduce the issue.
5. Observe the empty or undefined `req.body` in the server console.
6. Run `node bugSolution.js` to start the server with the corrected code.
7. Send another POST request to `/data` with a JSON payload and observe that `req.body` is now populated correctly.
